# Shortrocity

Shortrocity is a tool for making AI generated short videos ("shorts" or "reels") with a ChatGPT generated script, narrated by ElevenLabs or OpenAI text-to-speech. DALL-E 3 generated background images are also added to the background.

## Quick Start

Start Koboldcpp

Then, put your source content in a file, for example `source.txt` and run the `main.py`:

```console
$ ./main.py source.txt
